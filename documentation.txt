* Getting UART working on the PrimusX

Initialise UART2 to use the UART interface on the PrimusX Breakout Board

Always read UART data in an if statement with the condition set to the return value of the function rxBytesWaiting() in the UART class *V_IMP*

Similarly, write UART data in an if statement with the condition set to the return value of the function txBytesFree()

The characters corresponding to each command must NOT be stored in a variable on the .ino file flashed on the ESP32 WiFi module. Print the character directly. e.g use SerialPort.print('c') instead of, say using SerialPort.print(forward) where forward = 'c'

* Some general observations

Run Arduino as sudo on Linux to be able to burn .ino files onto the ESP32, or any other board for that matter

Cygnus IDE on Linux requires JDK 8 to be installed. However, projects flashed using it don't seem to work as reliably as the ones flashed using the Windows version. So please avoid

Use Pluto Controller on Android as it is updated more often and works more reliably than the iOS version
